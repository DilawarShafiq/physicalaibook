# Module 2: Digital Twin & Gazebo Simulation

In this module, you'll learn to create sophisticated robot simulations using Gazebo, bridging the gap between virtual and physical AI.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up realistic robot simulation environments in Gazebo
- Develop sim-to-real transfer techniques for physical robots
- Validate algorithms in simulation before real-world deployment
- Implement domain randomization for robust perception systems

## Module Structure

- **Week 4**: Introduction to Gazebo Classic & Gazebo Garden
- **Week 5**: URDF Modeling & Physics Tuning
- **Week 6**: Sim-to-Real Transfer & Validation

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- A functioning ROS 2 Humble environment
- Basic understanding of robot kinematics
- Completed the ROS 2 simulation tutorials

## Overview

This module covers Digital Twin technology - creating accurate virtual representations of your physical robot systems. We'll use Gazebo as our primary simulation environment, learning to create photorealistic worlds where robots can be tested, validated, and optimized before deployment on physical hardware.

### Key Concepts

1. **Digital Twin Validation**: Testing algorithms in simulation before real-world deployment
2. **Physics Fidelity**: Accurately modeling real-world physics in simulation
3. **Sensor Simulation**: Emulating real sensors with realistic noise models
4. **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Techniques to bridge simulation-to-reality gap

:::caution
Simulation is a powerful tool, but remember the "Reality Gap" - algorithms that work perfectly in simulation may behave differently in the real world.
