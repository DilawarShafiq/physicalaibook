# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Focus & Goal

This course provides a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to **Physical AI**—the convergence of artificial intelligence, robotics, and embodied systems. Through practical experience with ROS 2, digital twin simulation, NVIDIA Isaac, and vision-language-action (VLA) models, students will develop the skills to design, simulate, and deploy intelligent robotic systems that perceive, reason, and act in the physical world.

## Quarter Overview

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course! This 13-week journey will take you from foundational robotics concepts to cutting-edge AI-powered embodied intelligence.

### What You'll Build

By the end of this quarter, you will have:

- **Functional ROS 2 Skills**: Create nodes, publish/subscribe to topics, and orchestrate multi-robot systems
- **Digital Twin Expertise**: Build and test robot behaviors in Gazebo simulation before physical deployment
- **AI Integration**: Connect neural networks and LLMs to robotic decision-making pipelines
- **Real Hardware Experience**: Deploy your code to NVIDIA Jetson edge devices with vision and audio sensors

### Course Structure

The curriculum is organized into four progressive modules:

1. **Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals** (Weeks 1-3)
   - Master the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) framework
   - Learn publisher/subscriber patterns, services, and actions
   - Build your first autonomous navigation system

2. **Module 2: Digital Twin & Gazebo Simulation** (Weeks 4-6)
   - Create high-fidelity robot simulations
   - Test algorithms in virtual environments
   - Bridge simulation-to-reality gap with best practices

3. **Module 3: AI-Robot Brain & NVIDIA Isaac** (Weeks 7-10)
   - Deploy perception models (object detection, segmentation)
   - Use NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic training
   - Implement reinforcement learning for manipulation tasks

4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) & LLMs** (Weeks 11-13)
   - Integrate large language models with robot control
   - Build natural language command interfaces
   - Deploy VLA models for open-ended manipulation

### Prerequisites

- **Programming**: Intermediate Python (OOP, async/await)
- **Math**: Linear algebra basics (vectors, matrices)
- **Hardware**: Access to Digital Twin Workstation (see Hardware Requirements)

### Course Philosophy

This is a **learn-by-building** course. Every concept is immediately applied in labs and projects. You will:

- Write code daily
- Debug real robot failures
- Deploy to physical hardware
- Present a final capstone project

### Getting Started
