# 🔧 Quick Fix - Backend Setup

## The Issue

You're using **Python 3.13** which is brand new (released October 2024). Many packages like `pydantic-core` don't have pre-compiled wheels yet and require Rust to build.

## ✅ Solution: Use Python 3.11

### Option 1: Windows Python Installer (Easiest)

1. **Download Python 3.11.9**
   - Go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3119/
   - Download: "Windows installer (64-bit)"
   - Run installer, check "Add Python 3.11 to PATH"

2. **Create Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\TechTiesIbrahim\physicalaibook\backend
   py -3.11 -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run Backend**
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

### Option 2: Use Conda (If you have it)

```bash
conda create -n physicalai python=3.11
conda activate physicalai
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

## 🎯 Then Test Everything!

### Terminal 1: Frontend (Already Running!)
```bash
# Already at http://localhost:3000/physicalaibook/
npm start
```

### Terminal 2: Backend
```bash
cd backend
venv\Scripts\activate  # or: conda activate physicalai
python run.py
```

## ✅ What Will Work

Once backend is running:

1. **Open**: http://localhost:3000/physicalaibook/
2. **Sign up** with your experience levels
3. **Click "Personalize for Me"** on any chapter
4. **Click "Translate to Urdu"** to see translation
5. **Enjoy** your AI-powered textbook!
